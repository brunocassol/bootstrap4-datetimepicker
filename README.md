# Bootstrap4 Datetimepicker

This is a fork of the excellent but discontinued [tempusdominus/bootstrap-4](https://github.com/tempusdominus/bootstrap-4).

The goal is to mantain it with comunity help by applying small improvements and bug fixes since we need the component for professional projects.

# Todo

1. Take a look and merge PRs from [tempusdominus/bootstrap-4](https://github.com/tempusdominus/bootstrap-4) in this repo.
1. Setup github page with demos.
1. Setup npm package.
1. Document usage here on README.
1. Setup CDN so people can use it easily.
1. Switch from discontinued [momment.js](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/) to another date library. Perhaps [Day,js](https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs)?
1. Cleanup project if needed. Simplify.

# Requirements

- jQuery
- Bootstrap 4
- momment.js

# Installation

- Make sure you have the requirements. Then include these two files on your page:
	- https://github.com/brunocassol/bootstrap4-datetimepicker/blob/main/build/css/tempusdominus-bootstrap-4.min.css
	- https://github.com/brunocassol/bootstrap4-datetimepicker/blob/main/build/js/tempusdominus-bootstrap-4.min.js
